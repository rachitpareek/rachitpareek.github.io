<body class="is-preload align-center">
    This is a sample post I made today. I've been doing a lot of reading and want to analyze and distill my thoughts on
    a variety of categories here so they might become more easily accessible to me and useful to others. I hope to talk
    about mindfulness, relationships, aphorisms/quotes, finance, good influences on my life, entertainment, and whatever
    else feels important to me. This is a bit of a public journaling experiment.
